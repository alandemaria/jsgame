First attempt of a toy game using p5.js with objects.

The idea is to cross the uppermost right ball to the lower left corner by clicking and dragging it. Random balls move across the other diagonal to prevent you from reaching the other side. If the balls collide, you lose.

TODO:
- Parametrize the difficulty (increase randomness of crossing ball's movements and the quantity of balls)
- Remove hard-code bits (canvas size, radii of balls, etc)
- Change color of main ball for better visualization
